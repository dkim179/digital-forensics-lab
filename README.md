# 🕵️‍♂️ Digital Forensics Home-Lab
Building and practicing home-lab environments that simulate real-world digital forensics workflows and investigation scenarios.

This repository documents my hands-on practice in digital forensics, OS artifact analysis, filesystem investigation, memory forensics, and network traffic analysis.  
The goal is to develop real field-ready skills applicable to law enforcement, cybercrime investigations, and security operations.

---

## 🔍 Objectives
- Build an investigation-ready forensic environment (Kali Linux, Autopsy, Sleuth Kit, Wireshark, etc.)
- Perform structured home-lab investigations on disk images, memory dumps, and network captures.
- Develop the ability to analyze artifacts, reconstruct timelines, identify malicious activity, and document findings.
- Prepare for real-world digital forensics work and future specialization in cybercrime investigation.

## 📄 Case Study Reports

Each investigation includes:
1. **Scope**  
2. **Evidence acquired**  
3. **Methods & tools used**  
4. **Findings & timeline reconstruction**  
5. **Indicators of compromise (IOC)**  
6. **Conclusion & recommended actions**

Reports will be added to `/reports` as Markdown or PDF.

## 🛡️ Future Learning Path
- Advanced memory forensics  
- Malware triage & reverse engineering basics  
- Cloud forensics (AWS, Azure logs)  
- Mobile device forensics  
- Chain of custody & proper evidence handling  
- Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR) case simulations

## 🤝 About This Project
This home-lab project is part of my ongoing preparation for professional work in **digital forensics and cybercrime investigation**, including potential specialization pathways such as:

- Law enforcement forensics units  
- Cybercrime investigation teams  
- SOC/IR (Security Operations & Incident Response)  
- CBSA Digital Forensics / Cyber Examination Unit (future goal)
